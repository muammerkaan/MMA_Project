# MMA_Project
The dataset used in this project provides in fight statistics for every mixed martial arts bout in the Ultimate Fighting Championships (UFC) history since the secound ever event held by the promotion. Mixed martial arts allows fighters to use a diverse array of techniques in order to reach victory, more so than other popular combat sports such as boxing, kickboxing, wrestling and jiu jitsu. It is due to this multifaceted nature of the sport that there has been much debate throughout the years regarding which techniques and styles of fighting are the most effective in acquiring victory. In this project I will build predictive models which will aim to predict the winner of each bout through the number of times each technique has been used during the fight by each fighter. Then through the use of recursive feature elimination I will aim to identify which techniques are the best at predicting the outcome of a fight, henceforth finding out which tecniques truly are the most effective in acquiring victory in mixed martial arts.
